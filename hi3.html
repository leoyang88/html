<h2>The Southern Colonies</h2>
<h3>Colonies in the Southern region:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Maryland, MD. Was founded by George Calvert aka Lord Baltimore for religious freedom for Catholics.</li>
        <li>North Carolina, NC. Was founded by a group of proprietors for trade and profits.</li>
        <li>South Carolina, SC. Also founded by a group of proprietors for trade and profits.</li>
        <li>Georgia, GA. Founded by James Oglethorpe as a debtor colony and a meat shield for South Carolina from the Native Americans.</li>
        <li>Virginia, VA. Was founded by John Smith for trade and profits.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Political:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>People usually invested in joint-stock companies to start a colony. The Southern Colonies are no different.</li>
        <li>The British Crown appoints the governor of the Royal Colonies.</li>
        <li>The first idea of a representative government was the Virginia House of Burgesses.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Economic:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The Southerners grew tobacco as a cash crop.</li>
        <li>Slavery in the Southern Colonies was growing as there were a lot of big farms that required the labor of many humans.</li>
        <li>The Southern Colonies had the agrarian cash crop system which grew tobacco, cotton, and indigo.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Geographic:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The Southern Colonies had flat land and was hot which made it perfect for growing crops such as tobacco.</li>
        <li>There were a lot of plantations for cash crops. The plantations relied on slavery.</li>
        <li>Down in the South, the growing seasons were long. This is another thing that attributes to the success of the cash crops in the South.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Society:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Maryland was originally founded for religious freedom for Catholics in Anglican England.</li>
        <li>Maryland then passed the Maryland Act of Toleration which protected all Christians.</li>
        <li>There were clear class divisions, the distances impeded growth of schools, and few cities developed in the South.</li>
    </ul>
